### :warning: beware! entering my gasconade

I am Jayaram Prabhu Durairaj, a software engineer and an avid statistics aficionado. My journey for Phd has just begun. Trying to make both my career and academic endeavors meet. I am quite proud of my academic accomplishments besides being a full-time software engineer, take a look at my [time-line](https://bicepjai.github.io/timeline/) on how I spend my spare time. Currently Kaggling all day (off-office hours :)) and implementing interesting papers on NLP and Computer Vision.
