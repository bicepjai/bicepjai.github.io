Following is a dialogue from <strong>The Matrix</strong>

Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.
<br><br>
Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery.
<br><br>
The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

This stood out after watching this movie for the 42nd time. I knew why. Recently I went thru a bout of depression after an accident and that made me find philosophy, Cant stop reading/listening to philosophical content. Philosophy seems to be great thinkers subjective opinions (guided by experience, experiments and beliefs). Recently I had a self reflection on events in my life and come up with a strongly opinionated statement.

```
There are multiple ways to build one's character. 
One of them is empathy found through suffereing, 
specifically observed suffering rather than experienced suffering.
