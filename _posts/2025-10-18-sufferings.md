Following is a dialogue from <strong>The Matrix</strong>

<strong>AGENT SMITH</strong><br>
Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a perfect human world? Where none suffered, where everyone would be happy.
It was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost.
<br><br>
Some believed we lacked the programming language to describe your perfect world.
But I believe that, as a species, human beings define their reality through suffering and misery.
<br><br>
The perfect world was a dream that your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from.
Which is why the Matrix was redesigned to this: the peak of your civilization.

### Statement
This stood out after watching this movie for the 42nd time. I knew why. Recently I went thru a bout of depression after an accident and that made me find philosophy, Cant stop reading/listening to philosophical content. Philosophy seems to be great thinkers subjective opinions (guided by experience, experiments and beliefs). Recently I had a self reflection on events in my life and come up with a strongly opinionated statement.

```
There are multiple ways to build one's character. 
One of them is empathy found through suffereing, 
specifically observed suffering rather than experienced suffering.
```

Why do i say that ? I was self reflecting about my life experiences with my wife, that made me come to this conclusions.
<br>
### Observation 1
Growing up I had an abusive father. It was not physical abuse and it was not me who was abused, it was my mother. She had to deal with a very alcohilic husband who provided little to no support to run the family. Extracting money to go thru day to day activities was a never ending chore for her. 
<br>
He was never home and did not care about his kids, but my mother was motivated to pull ourself out of this man-made disaster by providing her kids with best edcation that she can afford. She did succeed with providing for her kids but it was at the cost of her suffering. I have seen my mom dealing with society treating her the worst just because her husband was a drunkard. She had to hear things like "Those are drunkards kids" even though we did not have any say in this. I have experienced her anger and sadness, sometimes at the sametime. There are times when her husband would try to hang himself or try to chop his pinky off with a mallet or burn real cash which we did not have much of or scream some crazy combination of curse words, just because he needed attention. I cannot forgive him for abusing our lovely dog(s). I can go on and on, but you get the picture. 
<br>
This is not to say we did not have any good moments in life, we did. But there is something about negative experience that is not adequately compensated by positive ones which leads to uneven memories. I empathized my mother suffering and made an oath to myself that I would never drink again since it has such great negative influence on loved ones.
<br>
We can argue I was also experiencing suffering here, but if my memories serve me right, I can assure you I felt like a helpless cared observer of the love of my life's pain. Just watching her agnoizing suffering made me create  one of my own moral code "Never ever will i drink or use curse words".

### Observation 1
I went to college and after that she did suffer more, but I did not get to be an observer of her o-n-oing suffering. In college I had my second interesting experience. The very oath I took bit me on my back, I became a social pariah as a kid who would not use curse words or drink alcohol, how you ask, I dont remember that but I think good morals do stand out (thats how we use to choose leaders). 
Now I felt like a victim and could smell my suffering, but I was an adult and I had to stand up for myself so I broke my oath heavily to protect myself which interestingly made me famous.
I almost became my dad himself. I constantly did drink alcohol, smoke excessively and have even abused others. Keen observation i made recenlty is that i never did see anyone suffer at the scale i experienced with my mother. It was a constant chase, no time to empathize since that was not something young myself was capable of. There were moments that was seen as cool to abuse others just because I had will and power to do so.
I did not realize that until i obdserved someone's suffering at a distance, I still remember that incident which made me realize how I was a solo performer in my act for others.

### Ratinal argument
Ok so observing suffering made me empathize more than experiencing suffering. In fact experiencing sufferring made me non-empathetic as part of self preservation. You could ask then why did my mother no act the same way, My answer is its because people like her are the ones who break the cycle of suffering. I can come up with more some more supporting arguemnts.

Civil disobeince had more effect in obtaining India its independance than the violent counterpart, its well documentated event. 

Civil Rights Movement could be the single most significant reason why US has Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

We can even cite wars that ended just because of people observed the suffering long enough. That is one thing I had to note, experiencing suffering makes you act faster than observing suffering. Though observing suffering help syou empathize and brings about the change, it takes time and many people are probably going thru some of that now.
